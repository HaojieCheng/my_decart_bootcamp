    "Although graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been the primary interface for most users using a computer since the mid-1990s, both Windows and UNIX-variants come with programs called **shells** that allow the user to interact with the operating system by typing commands in the shell: command line interfaces (CLI). In some disciplines, such as bioinformatics, the vast majority of tools are run from the command line.\n",
